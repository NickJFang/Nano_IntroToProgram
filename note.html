   I want to make this smile face shown on the web! But it shows all at a line.

<b>Computers Are Stupid</b>
<p>computer can not understand ambiguity as well as human. So programming language are designed to limit ambiguity and make sure the computer to act as what we want it to be.</p>

<p>Also we learn tags. some are inline such as strong, form, and span. Some are Block like div and p.</p>
